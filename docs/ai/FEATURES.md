---

### [FEAT-037]: Duplicate Submission Prevention

**Status:** ✅ Done
**Branch:** `dev`

**Description:** Comprehensive fix for duplicate submissions across the app. Prevents double form submissions, fixes race conditions in sync engine, and improves idempotency key handling.

**Root Causes Fixed:**
1. **Double-tap on submit buttons** - No guard against rapid taps before loading state updates
2. **Sync engine race condition** - Multiple concurrent sync calls processing same queue items
3. **Idempotency key removal** - Keys removed immediately after success, not protecting rapid retries

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Create reusable `SubmissionGuard` mixin for form submissions
- [x] Apply guard to `LogPostCreateScreen` and `RecipeCreateScreen`
- [x] Fix race condition in `LogSyncEngine._processSyncQueue()`
- [x] Keep idempotency keys for 30 seconds (TTL) instead of removing immediately
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests for all fixes (51 tests)

**Technical Notes:**
- `SubmissionGuard` mixin (`lib/core/utils/submission_guard.dart`):
  - Provides `guardedSubmit<T>()` method that blocks concurrent calls
  - Returns `null` for blocked calls, action result for executed calls
  - Automatically resets state on completion or error
- `LogSyncEngine` fix (`lib/data/datasources/sync/log_sync_engine.dart`):
  - Set `_isSyncing = true` IMMEDIATELY after check, before any async operations
  - Previous code had async gap allowing multiple concurrent executions
- `IdempotencyInterceptor` fix (`lib/core/network/idempotency_interceptor.dart`):
  - Added `_IdempotencyEntry` class with TTL tracking
  - Keys persist for 30 seconds to prevent duplicates from rapid double-taps
  - Keys still cleared on non-retryable errors (4xx, 500)

**Tests Added:**
- `test/core/utils/submission_guard_test.dart` (11 tests)
- `test/core/network/idempotency_interceptor_test.dart` (25 tests)
- `test/data/datasources/sync/log_sync_engine_test.dart` (5 new concurrency tests)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add a bio and social media links to my profile, so that other users can learn about me and find my content on other platforms.

**Research Findings:**

### [FEAT-029]: International Measurement Units

**Status:** 📋 Planned

**Description:** Structured ingredient measurements with unit conversion and recipe scaling for global users. Replaces free-text amount field with numeric quantity + unit enum.

**User Story:** As an international user, I want to view recipe ingredients in my preferred measurement system (metric/US), so that I can follow recipes without manual conversion.

**Research Findings:**
- How Paprika does it: Structured input (qty + unit dropdown), user preference setting, one-click conversion
- Industry standard: 67% of international recipe users rely on automated unit converters (CookSmart 2025)
- Pitfall to avoid: Volume↔weight conversion requires ingredient density database (too complex, unreliable)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] New `MeasurementUnit` enum (ML, L, TSP, TBSP, CUP, G, KG, OZ, LB, PIECE, PINCH, etc.)
- [ ] RecipeIngredient entity: add `quantity` (Double) + `unit` (Enum), keep `amount` for legacy
- [ ] User preference: METRIC / US / ORIGINAL (stored in user profile)
- [ ] Locale-based default detection on signup (US locale → US units, others → Metric)
- [ ] Conversion service: volume↔volume, weight↔weight only (no density guessing)
- [ ] Frontend: quantity input + unit dropdown (replaces free-text amount)
- [ ] Recipe scaling: adjust servings, ingredients auto-scale
- [ ] Legacy support: existing recipes with string amounts continue to work
- [ ] Settings page: "Measurement units" preference option

**Technical Notes:**
- Backend:
  - `MeasurementUnit.java` enum
  - `RecipeIngredient.java`: add `quantity`, `unit` fields (nullable for legacy)
  - `User.java`: add `measurementPreference` field
  - `MeasurementConversionService.java`: conversion logic
  - DB migration: add columns to `recipe_ingredients` and `users` tables
- Frontend:
  - `measurement_unit.dart` enum
  - `measurement_service.dart` for conversion
  - `ingredient_section.dart`: structured input UI
  - `kitchen_proof_ingredients.dart`: display with conversion
  - Settings page for preference
- Conversion rates (to base units):
  - Volume → ML: CUP=240, TBSP=15, TSP=5, FL_OZ=30
  - Weight → G: OZ=28.35, LB=453.59, KG=1000

# 🏛️ DECISIONS

## Template

```markdown
### [DEC-XXX]: Decision Title

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** ✅ Accepted | ❌ Rejected

**Context:** Problem we faced
**Decision:** What we chose
**Reason:** Why
**Alternatives:** What else we considered
```

---

### [DEC-001]: Isar for Local Database

**Date:** 2024-12-15
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:** Need offline caching with query support.
**Decision:** Use Isar
**Reason:** Type-safe, fast, supports queries (unlike Hive)
**Alternatives:** Hive (no queries), SQLite (too heavy), Drift (SQL-based)

---

### [DEC-002]: Either<Failure, T> for Error Handling

**Date:** 2024-12-20
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:** Need consistent error handling.
**Decision:** Use Either from dartz package
**Reason:** Forces explicit handling, type-safe, clear contracts
**Alternatives:** Try-catch (easy to forget), nullable returns (loses info)

---

### [DEC-003]: publicId (UUID) for API

**Date:** 2024-12-18
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:** Don't want to expose internal DB IDs.
**Decision:** Every entity has `id` (internal Long) + `publicId` (UUID)
**Reason:** Security, flexibility, works across distributed systems
**Alternatives:** Expose internal ID (security risk), UUID as PK (performance)

---

### [DEC-004]: Soft Delete

**Date:** 2024-12-22
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:** Preserve data for variations, allow recovery.
**Decision:** Use `deleted_at` timestamp instead of hard delete
**Reason:** Maintains references, audit trail, recovery
**Alternatives:** Hard delete (loses data), archive table (complex)

---

### [DEC-005]: Firebase Auth + Backend JWT

**Date:** 2024-12-10
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:** Need social login without managing OAuth.
**Decision:** Firebase for social login, exchange for our JWT
**Reason:** Firebase handles complexity, we control our JWT
**Alternatives:** Firebase only (vendor lock), self-hosted OAuth (complex)

---

### [DEC-006]: PostgreSQL for Idempotency Keys

**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:** Need storage for idempotency keys with 24h TTL.
**Decision:** Use PostgreSQL table with scheduled cleanup
**Reason:** No new infrastructure, transactional with main data, simpler deployment
**Alternatives:** Redis (faster, built-in TTL, but extra dependency and sync complexity)

---

### [DEC-007]: Physical Device Development with ADB Reverse

**Date:** 2026-01-12
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:** Need to test on physical Android devices connected via USB while backend runs on localhost.
**Decision:** Use `adb reverse` for port forwarding, with explicit localhost config in .env
**Reason:** Simple setup, no network configuration needed, works reliably with USB
**Setup:**
```bash
adb reverse tcp:4001 tcp:4001  # Backend API
adb reverse tcp:9000 tcp:9000  # MinIO images
```
**Config:** Set `BASE_URL=http://localhost:4001/api/v1` in `.env` to use localhost mode
**Alternatives:**
- Use computer's IP address (requires same network, IP changes)
- Android emulator with 10.0.2.2 (can't test real device features)
